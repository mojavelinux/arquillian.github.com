In this follow-up to the "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started guide, you'll have a chance to review what you've learned about Arquillian by exploring a slightly more complex example. After reading this guide, you'll be able to:

* Write an Arquillian test that demonstrates CDI(Contexts and Dependency Injection) and EJB(Enterprise JavaBeans) working together
* Execute an Arquillian test in a remote container (i.e., server)
* Debug an Arquillian test inside the remote container

You'll learn all of these skills by incorporating additional profiles to your build that, when activated, will cause Arquillian to run the tests in a remote container (i.e., server). That means you'll be testing the _real deal_. No mocks. No embedded runtimes! Since you've done most of the hard work in the first guide, it won't take long to get there.

h3. Assumptions

This guide assumes you have added the Arquillian infrastructure to your test suite and have written and executed at least one Arquillian test. If you haven't yet, please read the "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started guide to become familiar with the basics of Arquillian. You'll also need the prerequisite software mentioned in that guide.

h3. Create the Components

In this guide, we'll be creating a very basic backend for a shopping application. We'll use a basket component to store the visitor's selected items and an order repository component to store and retrieve placed orders. We'll implement these components using CDI and EJB, respectively. We can immediately start using these two programming models since we already have the Java EE 6 API on the classpath. (Refer to the "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started guide for instructions on how to add this API to your project).

Let's start with the component that moves the orders to and from permanent storage. Following good software design, and to simplify testing, we'll begin by defining an interface that defines the contract. In your IDE, create a new local EJB interface named @OrderRepository@ and populate it with the following contents:

div(filename). src/main/java/org/arquillian/example/OrderRepository.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import java.util.List;
import javax.ejb.Local;

@Local
public interface OrderRepository {
    void addOrder(List<String> order);
    List<List<String>> getOrders();
    int getOrderCount();
}

p. Let's worry about the implementation a bit later. Instead, let's move on to how we are going to use this contract.

As visitors browse the site, they'll put items in their baskets to purchase. To model this scenario, we'll use a CDI bean that is associated with the visitor's HTTP session. This component will then delegate to the @OrderRepository@ EJB when the visitor wants to purchase the selected items.

In your IDE, create a class named @Basket@ and assign it to the session context by adding the scope annotation @@SessionScoped@, as shown below:

div(filename). src/main/java/org/arquillian/example/Basket.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.ejb.EJB;
import javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped;

@SessionScoped
public class Basket implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private List<String> items;
    
    @EJB
    private OrderRepository repo;
    
    public void addItem(String item) {
        items.add(item);
    }
    
    public List<String> getItems() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(items);
    }
    
    public int getItemCount() {
        return items.size();
    }
    
    public void placeOrder() {
        repo.addOrder(items);
        items.clear();
    }
    
    @PostConstruct
    void initialize() {
        items = new ArrayList<String>();
    }
}

p. As you can see, we are wiring EJB to a CDI bean, precisely the integration we want to test!

h3. Implement in Phases

We aren't quite ready to write a test because we don't have an implementation of the @OrderRepository@. For the purpose of this example, let's assume that the @OrderRepository@ is being implemented by another team (or in another iteration). Here's where the micro-deployment feature of Arquillian really stands out. We can create an in-memory implementation as an EJB singleton and bundle it in the test archive to get a working application in the short term. (We may even decide to keep this implementation for the purpose of testing this boundary).

Create the class @SingletonOrderRepository@ in your test classpath and populate it with the code shown below:

div(filename). src/test/java/org/arquillian/example/SingletonOrderRepository.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.ejb.Lock;
import javax.ejb.LockType;
import javax.ejb.Singleton;

@Singleton
@Lock(LockType.READ)
public class SingletonOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
    private List<List<String>> orders;
    
    @Override
    @Lock(LockType.WRITE)
    public void addOrder(List<String> order) {
        orders.add(order);
    }
    
    @Override
    public List<List<String>> getOrders() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableList(orders);
    }
    
    @Override
    public int getOrderCount() {
        return orders.size();
    }
    
    @PostConstruct
    void initialize() {
        orders = new ArrayList<List<String>>();
    }
}

p. The added bonus of this implementation is that we get a chance to play around with the new singleton feature of EJB 3.1 in an Arquillian sandbox. That's why we like to say that Arquillian is a learning environment in addition to being a testing tool.

Now we are ready to write the Arquillian test.

h3. Write a Test

We are now going to write a test that simulates adding items to an instance of @Basket@, uses that instance to place an order and then validates that the order is processed and stored into the single @OrderRepository@ instance.

p(info). %Of course, we will only be testing the in-memory implementation. You'll learn how to write a test that uses a database in the "Testing Java Persistence":/guides/testing_java_persistence guide.%

Create the class @BasketTest@ and initialize it as an Arquillian test case:

div(filename). src/test/java/org/arquillian/example/BasketTest.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian;

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class BasketTest {
}

p. Next, we'll define a test archive that includes the basket, the order repository interface and its singleton implementation. We also need an empty beans.xml file to active CDI (EJB is automatically activated). Notice how we have complete control over the classpath by explicitly defining what goes into the archive.

div(filename). src/test/java/org/arquillian/example/BasketTest.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.api.Deployment;
import org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.ShrinkWrap;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.asset.EmptyAsset;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.JavaArchive;

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class BasketTest {
    @Deployment
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class, "test.jar")
            .addClasses(Basket.class, OrderRepository.class, SingletonOrderRepository.class)
            .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
    }
}

p. All that's left is to inject the basket and order repository into the test case and test their interaction. We'll be injecting the EJB interface, not the implementation. The EJB container will automatically find the implementation of the interface to use.

div(filename). src/test/java/org/arquillian/example/BasketTest.java

bc(prettify).. package org.arquillian.example;

import javax.ejb.EJB;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.jboss.arquillian.container.test.api.Deployment;
import org.jboss.arquillian.junit.Arquillian;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.ShrinkWrap;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.asset.EmptyAsset;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.JavaArchive;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class BasketTest {
    @Deployment
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class, "test.jar")
            .addClasses(Basket.class, OrderRepository.class, SingletonOrderRepository.class)
            .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
    }
    
    @Inject
    Basket basket;
    
    @EJB
    OrderRepository repo;
    
    @Test
    public void place_order_should_add_order() {
        basket.addItem("sunglasses");
        basket.addItem("suit");
        basket.placeOrder();
        Assert.assertEquals(1, repo.getOrderCount());
        Assert.assertEquals(0, basket.getItemCount());
        
        basket.addItem("raygun");
        basket.addItem("spaceship");
        basket.placeOrder();
        Assert.assertEquals(2, repo.getOrderCount());
        Assert.assertEquals(0, basket.getItemCount());
    }
    
    @Test
    public void order_should_be_persistent() {
        Assert.assertEquals(2, repo.getOrderCount());
    }
}

p. The test is written. Now we need to get setup to run it.

h3. Add the Remote Containers

The test we've written uses both CDI and EJB. That combination pushes the boundaries of what an embedded runtime (like Weld Embedded or OpenEJB Embedded) can provide. While possible, it's just simpler to use a compliant Java EE container. Plus, it gives us more accurate test results. So we'll leave the Weld Embedded container behind for now.

In the previous guide, we used both embedded and managed containers. In both cases, Arquillian must start the container when the test suite begins and stop it when the tests are finished. What if you already have a container started (or you are willing to start one for the purpose of testing)? That's obviously going to be the fastest way to run the tests. Even if the container starts very fast, nothing beats no startup at all. That's the purpose of the remote containers.

Remote containers provide an ideal development environment for integration testing. You'll also discover that they also make debugging the test very straightforward. And since there is no reference to the container in the test, using a remote container during development does not prevent you from using a managed container for continous integration.

p(warning). %The term remote refers to a separate process, not necessarily a separate machine, though it can accomodate that setup.%

A remote container is a standalone process to which Arquillian deploys using the container's client deployment APIs. Therefore, the libraries you need are:

* APIs of the programming model (only need to be packaged if the container does not provide them)
* The Arquillian remote container adapter
* The client deployment APIs for communicating with the container process

In your Maven pom.xml file, add two new profiles under the @<profiles>@ element. The first profile uses a remote JBoss AS 7 container:

div(filename). pom.xml

bc(prettify).. <!-- clip -->
<profile>
    <id>arquillian-jbossas-remote</id>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.spec</groupId>
            <artifactId>jboss-javaee-6.0</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0.Final</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.as</groupId>
            <artifactId>jboss-as-arquillian-container-remote</artifactId>

            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</profile>
<!-- clip -->

p. The second profile uses a remote GlassFish 3.1 container:

div(filename). pom.xml

bc(prettify).. <!-- clip -->
<profile>
    <id>arquillian-glassfish-remote</id>
    <dependencies>

        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</profile>
<!-- clip -->

p(info). %The remote GlassFish adapter uses Jersey to communicate with the container via JAX-RS (REST) and thus requires these additional libraries. The Weld API is required for unmarshalling exceptions returned by the container process.%

Once you've added the profiles to the pom.xml, right click on the project in Eclipse and select Maven > Update Project Configuration. If the project is showing compiler errors, you need to activate one of the profiles.

Recall that there are two ways to activate a Maven profile in Eclipse:

# Manual configuration (standard approach)
# Maven profile selector (JBoss Tools)

Refer to the "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started#test_across_containers for instructions on how to activate a profile. Once you've activate the profile, the project should compile cleanly.

Arquillian is expecting the container to be running. Therefore, let's get them setup so that we can start them from the comfort of the IDE right before we run the test.

h3. Control the Servers

The easiest way to manage the remote containers is to set them up in your IDE. If you're a more of a commandline person, you can skip this step and start the servers using the appropriate startup scripts.

We'll show you how to add the server (container) controls in Eclipse. The process is similar for other IDEs. For Eclipse, you'll need both "JBoss Tools":http://jboss.org/tools and the GlassFish Java EE Application Server Plugin, both of which are available in the Eclipse MarketPlace.

In Eclipse, select Window > Show View > Servers from the main menubar. Once the view opens, right click and select New > Server. You'll want to define one server for JBoss AS 7 and one for GlassFish 3.1. For JBoss AS 7, the wizard requires that you have already downloaded and extracted the JBoss AS 7 runtime. The GlassFish 3.1 wizard gives you the option of downloading the distribution automatically.

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_new_jbossas_server.png!

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_new_glassfish_server.png!

Once you have completed the wizard for each container, you should see them appear in the server view.

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_servers_view.png!

To start a server, select the entry (as shown in the graphic above) and click the green play icon.

p(info). %Arquillian assumes the containers are running on their default ports. If you have changed the ports, you can use arquillian.xml to specify the ports you are using for each container.%

Now that you've got the containers ready and waiting, it's time to fire the test off to them.

h3. Run the Arquillian Test

To run the Arquillian test, you need to perform three steps:

# Start the remote container
# Activate the Maven profile that adds the cooresponding container adapter to the classpath
# Run the test

Let's start by using JBoss AS 7.

h4. Run the Test on JBoss AS

To run the test on JBoss AS, begin by starting the JBoss AS container. Open the Servers view, select JBoss AS 7, then click the green play button. Wait for it to start (it shouldn't take long).

Once that's up and running, activate the @arquillian-jbossas-remote@ Maven profile using either the Maven properties tab or the JBoss Tools Maven profile selector. The profile editor below shows the correct selection.

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_jbossas_profile_selection.png!

Finally, right click on the @BasketTest@ class and select Run As > JUnit Test. You should see a flurry of activity in the Console view and a successful result in the JUnit view.

You can also run the test on the commandline using Maven:

bc(command). $ mvn test -Parquillian-jbossas-remote -Dtest=BasketTest

You should see the following lines printed to the console:

pre(output). -------------------------------------------------------
T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running org.arquillian.example.BasketTest
...
Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5.464 sec

*Congratulations!* You've earned your first *(greenbar)green bar* with Arquillian using a remote container.

p(info). %You can also inject the EJB using @@Inject@ rather than @@EJB@. Give it a try!%

If you want to verify that the singleton is actually doing its job, go ahead and remove the @@Singleton@ annotation from the @SingletonOrderRepository@ class. You should see an assertion error when you run the test. Restore it and you'll be back to green.

Now let's test the exact same test on GlassFish 3.1. Since we are done with JBoss AS for the moment, use the Servers view to stop the server.

h4. Run the Test on GlassFish

To run the test on GlassFish, begin by starting the GlassFish container. Open the Servers view, select GlassFish 3.1, then click the green play button. Wait for it to start.

Once that's up and running, activate the @arquillian-glassfish-remote@ Maven profile using either the Maven properties tab or the JBoss Tools Maven profile selector. Remember to deactivate the @arquillian-jbossas-remote@ profile. The profile editor below shows the correct selection.

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_glassfish_profile_selection.png!

Finally, right click on the @BasketTest@ class and select Run As > JUnit Test. You should see a flurry of activity in the Console view and a successful result in the JUnit view.

*Congratulations!* You've earned another *(greenbar)green bar*.

h3. Debug the Arquillian Test

Debugging a test in a remote container? That seems hard. Surprise! It's not at all. You only have to modifiy one of the step above and add one additional step:

# *Debug* the remote container
# Activate the Maven profile that adds the cooresponding container adapter to the classpath
# *Set a breakpoint*
# Run the test

In the Servers view, you should notice that there is a bug icon right next to the green play button. Click this button to start one of the servers in debug mode. Eclipse automatically connects its debugger to the container.

Set a breakpoint in the @addOrder()@ method on the @SingletonOrderRepository@ bean. Now, run the test again by right clicking and selecting Run As > JUnit Test.

p(warning). %You don't need to use Debug As > JUnit Test since all the test code is running inside the container, which is already being debugged.%

The test should halt at the breakpoint. If you are using JBoss AS, you can open the administration console and verify that the test application is currently deployed to the server. If you browse the stack trace in the Eclipse Debug view, you'll notice that the server is being controlled over a remote protocol (either JMX or Servlet) and that JUnit is being launched from inside the container.

!/images/guides/arquillian_tutorial_2_debug_remote_test.png!

You are now poking around the server from the comfort of your IDE.
